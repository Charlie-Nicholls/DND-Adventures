### Description
At the age of 10, [[Summer Night]] ran away from home and got lost in the [[Feywild]]. She made a deal with a hag, who gave her the power to make her dreams a reality, but in return cursed her to die the next time she woke. Her first dream was of [[The Sandman]], a creature that would tend to her while she slept. His right hand is clenched in a fist, through which runs sand that represents how long [[Summer Night|Summer]] has before she runs out of dreams and wakes. In his left he holds a dream-catcher, which he can use on the sleeping to steal their dreams and bring them to [[Summer Night|Summer]] to give to her. 

After a while she would dream of [[Hotel Midsummer]] which quickly became a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. [[The Sandman]] would collect a dream as you slept and bring it to [[Summer Night|Summer]], weaving it into the dream of the hotel. It is then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake and allowing [[Summer Night|Summer]] to continue to sleep and live in the dreams of others. The dream is kept alive in that room forever as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. It's said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever; that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But [[Summer Night|Summer]] and her [[Hotel Midsummer|Hotel]] have become trapped inside [[Phantasmal Gem]], the guests within unable to leave and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time [[The Sandman]] has become increasingly desperate to keep [[Summer Night|Summer]] dreaming. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually he had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. The guests have long since run out of dreams, causing them to lose the ability to sleep. Those who die from lack of sleep can find themselves trapped in [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]], if any were in their room. These unfortunate souls become [[The Echoes]], forced to relive their dreams or nightmares until they can change the outcome.

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued relentlessly by [[The Sandman]]. A creature which can only be seen when your eyes are closed, who sends to sleep any who he touches. In his time here he has learned the nature of the gem and believes they can at last escape, if only he can collect a few more [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] to finish his teleportation device, before [[Summer Night|Summer]] wakes up. But, with the hotel infested with nightmares and far beyond saving, this would surely result only more people becoming ensnared, and the horrors held within escaping into the [[Feywild]]. But [[Summer Night|Summer]] is tired and scared, living in an endless nightmare. Would she even want to be saved if he could?
