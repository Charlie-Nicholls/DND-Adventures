### Description
At the age of 10, [[Summer Night]] ran away from home and got lost in the [[Feywild]]. She made a deal with a [[Nightmare Hag]], who gave her the power to make her dreams a reality, but in return asked for a tithe in nightmares. Her first dream was of [[The Sandman]], a creature that resembled her dead father who would protect her. His right hand is clenched in a fist, through which runs sand that represents how long [[Summer Night|Summer]] has before she runs out of dreams, wakes and dies. In his left he holds a dream-catcher, which he can use on the sleeping to steal their dreams and bring them to [[Summer Night|Summer]] to give to her. 

After a while she became exhausted by the constant requirement of having nightmares for the hag and [[The Sandman]] stole her away to safety. She would then dream of [[Hotel Midsummer]] which quickly became a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. [[The Sandman]] would collect a dream as you slept and bring it to [[Summer Night|Summer]], weaving it into the dream of the hotel. It is then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake and allowing [[Summer Night|Summer]] to continue to sleep and live in the dreams of others. The dream is kept alive in that room forever as payment, and you would never be able to dream it again. It's said the twisting space of the hotel's interior goes on forever; that everyone has a room ready for them somewhere.

But the [[Nightmare Hag]] found them and trapped [[Summer Night|Summer]] and her [[Hotel Midsummer|Hotel]] inside [[Phantasmal Gem]], the guests within unable to leave and no new dreamers able to arrive. Over time [[The Sandman]] has become increasingly desperate to keep [[Summer Night|Summer]] dreaming. Feeding over and over again on the same guests, taking more and more dreams from them. Eventually he had no choice but to start using nightmares, this power source has steadily corrupted the hotel; turning it from a vibrant place of joy to a twisting corridor of horrors. The guests have long since run out of dreams, causing them to lose the ability to sleep. Those who die from lack of sleep can find themselves trapped in [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]], if any were in their room. These unfortunate souls become [[The Echoes]], forced to relive their dreams or nightmares until they can change the outcome.

Those who find themselves in the halls of [[Hotel Midsummer]] are pursued relentlessly by [[The Sandman]]. The nightmares have warped him and is in the process of becoming a new [[Nightmare Hag]]. He can only be seen when your eyes are closed and he sends to sleep anyone he touches. One of the guests [[The Echoes#Warwin Squiggle]] was a wizard, able to design a couplet of runes that would enhance and reverse the trapping magics of the [[Phantasmal Gem]] to expel them. He required [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] to make the runes of, but succumbed to exhaustion while collecting them. With the hotel infested with nightmares, [[The Sandman]] in pursual and [[Nightmare Hag]] on the other side of the [[Phantasmal Gem|Gem]], can the players save [[Summer Night|Summer]] or even survive at all?
