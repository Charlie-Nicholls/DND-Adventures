###### Chase Track Mechanics
<span class="sub2">:FasClock: Plan</span>

---
> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Chase Track
> - When a chase begins, [[The Sandman]] and the players are placed on the chase track, with the players slightly ahead. (tile 9 vs 1, target 21)
> - The players and [[The Sandman]] then alternate turns. Starting with the players taking a turn, then [[The Sandman]], after which the players take 2 turns for every 1 of [[The Sandman]]. 
> - The track does not only represent physical distance, but the "advantage" the players have over [[The Sandman]] in the chase, so, for example, being hidden, putting obstacles in his way or learning useful information are represented by the distance on the track but don't have a physical distance in of themselves.
> - Players can not take damage from the dreams, but they will still feel the pain or effects until they leave the room. Instead of damage, these effects are measured on the Chase Track
> - The players may either make a group check or have someone make an individual check. If a player makes an individual check, they cannot do so again until the others have made individual checks. (Can also do for example a pair or trio check, players must wait till the others make a checks of their own before they can make non-group checks.)
> - Refer to the Risk/Reward-Difficulty table to determine the movement that occurs during a players turn.
> - [[The Sandman]] on his turn makes his own check and rolls on the following table:
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Score | 1-8 | 9-18 | 19-20
>> |  :---: | :---: |   :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Movement** | 1 | 2 | 3 |
>
>> [!recite|clean no-i] Extra D6s
> - When rounding corners on the chase track there are two types of D6s that are rolled
> - Between the players and the exit is are two D6 representing [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]], if players pass this point they can roll the D6 + 3 to determine how many [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] they find.
>	- If they are caught by [[The Sandman]] before reaching this point he will instead steal the remaining [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]]
> - Between [[The Sandman]] and the players starting point are a further two D3s that he rolls to affect the dream itself.
>	- [[The Sandman]] takes an additional action on the following table and the players make a saving throw of the stated DC. Can be flexible and do a forced ability check instead of a saving throw.
>	- [[The Sandman]] moves forward an amount equal to the number of players who failed the save.
>
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | Roll | "-" (1/2) | " " (3/4) | "+" (5/6) |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Save DC** | 8 | 12 | 16 |

> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Risk/Reward-Difficulty Levels
> - Whenever a player makes some attempt to speed up their escape or slow down [[The Sandman]], judge the risk-reward level and difficulty and use the following table to determine how many shifts of movement they get. A success moves them forward and a failure moves [[The Sandman]] closer.
> - Let the players know that that there is a risk/reward-difficulty table so they can strategize how risky or hard the thing they want to do is, but not what exactly the table looks like.
>> [!recite|clean no-t]
>> | RR\Diff | Low | Medium | High | | Low (avg) | Medium (avg) | High (avg) |
>> |  :---: | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: |
>> | **Low** | DC12 +1/-0 | - | DC18 +2/-0 | | 0.7 | 1 | 0.81 |
>> | **Medium** | DC10 +1/-1 | DC16 +2/-1 | DC18 +3/-1 | | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.55 |
>> | **High** | DC14 +2/-2 | DC16 +3/-2 | DC20 +4/-3 | | 0.4 | 0.3 | -1 |
> - The Chase track can also be used over multiple rooms if they reach the natural end of a room without either escaping or being caught
> - If the Chase track is taking too long to complete, instead try starting the players at position 5 instead of 9 and giving both players and The Sandman a default +1 to all movement. Ignoring the starting conditions this could also be adjusted mid chase by adding 1 to both movements. Since players don't see the tables being rolled on they won't know this is a change.
> - [[The Sandman]] has an AC of 16 and any attempt to attack him counts as medium difficulty on the RR/Diff table. 
> 	- Attacking can also be considered Medium-Low (DC 16 +2/-0) if the player makes some sacrifice to make the attack, e.g. using a spell slot. This is also the default for effects that require [[The Sandman]] to make a saving throw.
> 	- Attacks made against [[The Sandman]] have disadvantage if the player does not close their eyes. Though closing their eyes for this can result in disadvantage on other rolls.
> 	- Medium-Medium is used when unsure.
> 	- Medium-High is usually used for melee attacks that require a player to approach [[The Sandman]] to attack them.
