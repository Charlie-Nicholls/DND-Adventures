###### Rooms
<span class="sub2">:FasClock: Plan</span>

---

### Notes
 - Some of the rooms are the leftovers of the long dead, some contain the [[The Echoes]].
	 - Try to make the [[The Echoes]] heart breaking
	 - [[The Echoes]] are trapped in [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]], helping them move on will reveal 10 shards and allow the players to collect them.
 - Three types of rooms, chase, challenge and echo rooms.
	 - Chase rooms are easier to navigate but will have them being closely perused by [[The Sandman]], having to find ways to slow him down or get through quickly
	 - Challenged focused rooms present some obstacle to exiting the room that has to be overcome, use one of these when they get away from [[The Sandman]] to justify him catching up
	 - Echo Rooms can be either chase or challenge rooms but contain an echo of a former guest, players who successfully help them get rewarded with extra [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]]
 - If [[The Sandman]] steals any of the party's dreams, these can appear as chase or challenge rooms later
 - Rooms can lead into each other or back into the corridor at the DMs discretion, usually into the corridor only after a chase track has been completed.
 - Below are some examples of rooms but more can be created easily. Most are based off common nightmares, but they could be nicer dreams from past guests as long as they present an interesting challenge a chase with [[The Sandman]].

> 	- Or can help out [[The Echoes|The Echo]] in the room which will gain [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] and allow the door to open early
> 		- Helping can look like having them not care about the opinions of the others or convincing the others it's a great idea
