# Profile

> [!boxed|no-t]
> A creature who walks in shadow even in the brightest light, her faces shrouded in darkness under the hood of the tattered shawl wrapped around her body. Her limbs are out of proportion, her legs bend in weird places at unnatural angles and four arms protrude from her shoulders. She has grey skin and long pointed black nails on the fingers of the hand which reaches out for you. Around her neck rests a neckless of bone, with a red gem embedded at its center.
