### Description

[[Summer Night]] grew up in a dysfunctional family, with an abusive mother and found her escape in dreams. Her father would try to protect her from her mother, but he died when she was 9. At the age of 10, she ran away from home and got lost in the [[Feywild]] and met the [[Nightmare Hag]]. The [[Nightmare Hag|Hag]] made a deal with her, she gave her the power to make her dreams a reality, but in return demanded a tithe in nightmares and cursed her to die the next time she woke. Her first dream was of [[The Sandman]], a dream version of her father that would tend to her while she slept. His right hand is clenched in a fist, through which runs sand that represents how long [[Summer Night|Summer]] has before she runs out of dreams and wakes. In his left he holds a dream-catcher, which he can use on the sleeping to steal their dreams and bring them to [[Summer Night|Summer]] to give to her. 

After a while she would dream of [[Hotel Midsummer]] which quickly became a popular stop off for travellers in the [[Feywild]], boasting the ability to let you live your dream. [[The Sandman]] would collect a dream as you slept and bring it to [[Summer Night|Summer]], weaving it into the dream of the hotel. It would then be brought to life in your room, ready for you to experience when you wake and allowing [[Summer Night|Summer]] to continue to sleep and live in the dreams of others. But when she refused to continue to spend so much time living in nightmares to pay the [[Nightmare Hag]]'s tithe, the [[Nightmare Hag|Hag]] trapped her and [[Hotel Midsummer]] in her [[Phantasmal Gem]].
