# Profile

> [!boxed|no-t]
> Long thin legs seem to make up the majority of his height with only a small torso attached. Inhumanly spindly arms reach out twice as far as is comfortable from body, each with two elbows that allow it to bend in either direction. One had is perpetually clenched into a fist, with a constant trickle of sand falling between his fingers, marking a path of dust wherever he treads. In the other is a circle of thread, woven into an intricate pattern, with several black feathers tied to the rim. He wears a dark cloak, draped loosely over his almost insect like body, and those unlucky enough to catch a glimpse under his dark hood would see his eyes are sewn shut.

### Description
The patron of [[Hotel Midsummer]], once a kindly being who would take the dreams of those who sleep at [[Hotel Midsummer]]. He wove the dreams into the room of the guests, allowing them to experience it when they woke and then keeping the dream alive in the room forever. Since becoming trapped in [[Phantasmal Gem]], he has become desperate. Without a supply of new guests he was forced first to use nightmares to power the hotel and has now drained his guests completely, rendering them unable to sleep at all. As a reflection of the hotel, he has become increasingly nightmarish to behold. If [[Summer Night|Summer]] remains only exposed to nightmares, he will eventually become a new [[Nightmare Hag]].

He was the first creature dreamed by [[Summer Night]] after making her deal with the [[Nightmare Hag]]. Originally resembling her late father, his purpose is to protect [[Summer Night|Summer]] and collect the dreams for her to live in. His right hand is clenched in a fist, through which runs sand that represents how long [[Summer Night|Summer]] has before she runs out of dreams and wakes. In his left he holds a dream-catcher, which he can use on the sleeping to steal their dreams and bring them to [[Summer Night|Summer]] to give to her. 

If [[The Sandman]] touches any of the players, he will steal one of their dreams and they take a level of exhaustion.
