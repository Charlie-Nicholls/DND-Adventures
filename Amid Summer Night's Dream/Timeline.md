### Entering the Hotel
- Describe them dreaming about being [[Summer Night]], running through a forest and finding a pool of water through which the [[Feywild]] can be seen. A shadowy figure in a cloak can be seen in the pool, when they enter the pool they wake.
	- This is the night she ran away from home and made a deal to bring her dreams to life.
	- Shadowy figure is the hag she makes a deal with, but the description looks similar to the [[The Sandman]].
- The first room they enter is a lavish bed room with an enormous oversized bed at its centre. In the middle of the bed is the body of a gnome.
- If they get close enough they can see he is holding brochure with "Whoever comes after, collect the shards, don't let him touch you" scrawled across it, sketches of various runes.
- A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals on of the rune is a magical magnification and the other is an polarity reverser
- A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check on the body shows he has signs of exhaustion, but no wounds.
- At this point they hear a scuffle from beneath the bed. Read:

> [!boxed|no-t]
> You hear a muffled scuffling sound coming from beneath you. It's probably nothing dangerous, but you realise you forgot something. You see, there are two types of people who check underneath the bed before they go to sleep. Children, because they're naÃ¯ve enough to think there might be monsters under the bed, and adventurers, because they're experienced enough to know that there might be monsters under the bed. You forgot to check under the bed.
>^StartMonster

- Looking under the bed will reveal an unnatural level of darkness. At this point [[The Sandman]] and his music starts echoing in from the corridor.
- [[Summer Night]] is under the bed, and a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check or dark vision will let them see her and she will ask for their help before an invisible monster grabs her, drags her further under the bed and she leaves the dream room. If they try to follow her, a door leading to a room of your choice can be found under the bed.
- If they go into the corridor before [[The Sandman]] reaches them, they will be chased down until the hotel manipulates its interior to lead them at a dead end with two or three doors they can look through before they choose which to enter.

### Reaching Reception
[[Summer Night|Summer]] will tell them to find reception if spoken to and there are various ways the group can get there:
- When they reach sufficient [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]], [[Summer Night|Summer]] will lead them to reception through the dreams, including [[Dream Rooms#Summer's Room]].
- Follow [[The Sandman]] to [[Summer Night|Summer]] after a dream is taken.
- If they come up with something else inventive allow that.

### Reception
- Here are a bunch more [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] laid out in the shape of the magnification rune, and a partially completed polarity reversal rune.
- [[The Echoes#Warwin Squiggle]], the [[The Echoes|Echo]] of a gnomish wizard who was trapped here. 
	- Before his death he learned about [[Summer Night]] and was determined to find a way to save her. 
	- He used the natural magic of the [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] to trap people along with a magnification rune to bring in more people to give [[The Sandman]] more dreams to extend [[Summer Night|Summer]]'s life while he worked on the reversal rune. 
	- He finished the rune and scribbled it on the back of the leaflet the players found, and succumbed to exhaustion when out looking for the final [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] he needed. This is the body they found at the start.
	- He is now one of [[The Echoes]], trapped in a loop of bringing people in and trying to finish his rune and obtain the [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] he needs to finish.
	- He will be put at peace when shown the completed runes and [[Phantasmal Gem#Gem Shards]] gathered by the players. His illusion of life beginning to break down as the players finish the runes and break out of the [[Phantasmal Gem]].
- [[Summer Night]] is in a bed in a staff room behind the reception desk. When the players get here, [[The Sandman]] will enter or already be in this room protecting [[Summer Night|Summer]]. She is about 15 years older than she looks in the dreams.
- [[The Sandman]]'s sand will be running low to indicate she is running out of dreams. If the players donate a dream, whoever is asleep will be able to interact with the [[The Sandman]] (he cannot talk but can manipulate dreams to answer questions)
- Anyone awake will be able to speak to [[Summer Night]] by finding her in any dream room. Room 1, the nearest room to reception, is the dream of [[Summer Night|Summer]] running through a forest, entering the [[Feywild]] and meeting a hag. This is the room they came from if [[Summer Night|Summer]] led them here.

### Nightmare Hag
- After escaping the [[Phantasmal Gem]], the [[Nightmare Hag]] will come to steal [[Summer Night|Summer]].
- If the players refuse to let her keep [[Summer Night|Summer]] and honour their deal she will initiate combat.
- She can use her *Weave Nightmare* ability on [[Summer Night|Summer]] to make [[Nightmare Creatures]] to attack the players.
- She is resistant to all damage when outside the [[Dream Rooms]]
- [[The Sandman]] can be instructed to manipulate the [[Dream Rooms]]
