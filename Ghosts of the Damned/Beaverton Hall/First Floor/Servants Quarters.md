>	The servant's quarters is a rather dull affair compared to the lavish rest of the house. A line of several beds, each partitioned off from each other, some chests and wardrobes but all simple and functional. A series of windows line the east wall, Irene was seen to fall through the second one along.

>	There are quite a few scuff marks by the window through which Irene fell which wouldn't have been caused normally. The adjacent window is hard to see out of as a tree completely obscures the view.

There is also small trace of blood on the window frame of this window. This blood is still bright red, which is strange as normally blood would have oxidised to a darker red by now.

>	There are quite a few scuff marks by the window through which Irene fell though seemingly only one set. Someone was struggling with something. The adjacent window is hard to see out of as a tree completely obscures the view, you see that a branch on the near side of the tree has recently broken off. There is also small trace of blood on the window frame of this window. This blood is still bright red, which must be fake as blood would have oxidsed a deeper red by now.
