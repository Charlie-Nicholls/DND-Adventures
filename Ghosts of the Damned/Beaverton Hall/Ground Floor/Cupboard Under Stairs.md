### Secret Passages
- Obscured behind coats is a door to the ⁠séance-control-room, there is a hidden door with no handle or keyhole that blends in with wall design but there's a just visible seam.
- If unlocked in the ⁠[[Séance Room]] it can be opened easily with the crowbar or with a Sleight of Hand check.
- If not unlocked then it can be opened with an Athletics check with the crowbar.
