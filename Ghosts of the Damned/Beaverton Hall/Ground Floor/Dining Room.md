> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The dining room is large, with the dining table of central focus. Candles are lit all along it and a Chandelier hangs on the far side. A series of tall windows line the east wall with dark red curtains drawn. A roaring fire is already going in the fireplace on the far side of the room.

### Connections
[[Downstairs Hallway]]
[[Séance Control Room]] (secret and blocked)

### Investigation Checks

Use alternatives for before Irene's ghost appears or investigation checks away from the fireplace afterwards.

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Easy
>	There is significantly more shattered glass on the floor than you would expect from the chandelier.
>^Easy

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Medium
>	There is significantly more shattered glass on the floor than you would expect from the chandelier and there's a lot more in the fireplace than seems possible. The bricks on the left side of the fireplace seem less dirty than the rest.
>^Medium

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Hard
>	There is significantly more shattered glass on the floor than you would expect from the chandelier, and there are two distinctly different thicknesses of shards. There's also a lot more glass in the fireplace than seems possible. The bricks on the left side of the fireplace seem less dirty than the rest.
>^Hard

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Nat 20
>	There is significantly more shattered glass on the floor than can have come from the chandelier, and there are two distinctly different thicknesses of shards. There's a lot of the thicker shards in the fireplace which can't have come from the chandelier. The bricks on the left side of the fireplace seem less dirty than the rest and a small seam can be seen where the two types meet. 

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Medium Alternative
> Before Irene's ghost appears:
>	There is some fishing wire barely visible running from one of the curtains to the chandelier. 
> After Irene's ghost appears:
> 
>	Looking over at the curtain there is a small metal pin hanging from the top by fishing wire.

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Hard Alternative
> Before Irene's ghost appears:
>	There is some fishing wire barely visible running from one of the curtains to the chandelier. It's hard to see from ground level but it's likely rigged to make it fall in some way.
> After Irene's ghost appears:
> 
>	Looking over at the curtain there is a small metal pin hanging from the top by fishing wire. This setup was used to cause the chandelier to fall when the curtain was opened.

### Secret Passages
- Brick Wall on swinging door in fireplace leading to ⁠[[Séance Control Room]].
- Easier to spot if investigated before fire starts and dirties new bricks.
- Will be extremely hard (potentially impossible) to open from this side if the heavy metal cabinet is blocking it from the other side.
