> The downstairs bathroom is rather elaborate. 5 Paintings are scattered across the wall, depicting a beautiful landscape, a cathedral, an Elizabethan building, a tree and a mural of carved figures. The far side of the room has busts of various figures, a wren, a nightingale, a deer, a chicken and a newt.

>> One of the heads is very slightly not straight and has a small fleck of blood on it. On testing you find they can be rotated and hear a clicking mechanism as you do. The fact one wasn't returned to it's original position implies the last person to use this was rushing. There is a slight echo to the clicking sound which leads you to believe there is some passage underneath the busts.
