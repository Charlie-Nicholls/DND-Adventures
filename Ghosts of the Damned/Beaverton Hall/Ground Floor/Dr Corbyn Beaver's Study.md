Another note reads "Rumours of cocaine addiction". On the shelf are a variety of scientific and medical textbooks and, unusually, a copy of a children's book called "The Tortoise and the Hare" which appears to be strangely well thumbed. In the bin you find a piece of paper with scrawled notes in Dr Beaver's Handwriting. It lists a variety of symptoms: headaches, memory issues, join pain, anger issues + violent and impulsive tendencies. Then a final diagnosis written beneath that has been scrawled out. You also notice the desk is noticeably thicker than the draw you remove from it.

Then a final diagnosis written beneath that has been scrawled out but you can just about make out reads "Lead Poisoning?".
