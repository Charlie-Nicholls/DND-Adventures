> The living room is a largely open space with a few tables and chairs, a sofa and a few doors leading off to other rooms. On the wall a series of photos can be seen showing the Beaver family. Three of the photos show the family you recognise, Squire Beaver, his wife and their son Corbyn. The final painting depicts an older male and female beaver, standing in front of the dam.

Hailing from a humble beginnings in the forests of Bavaria, they are depicted here on the day they completed construction of the world's first hydroelectric dam."
