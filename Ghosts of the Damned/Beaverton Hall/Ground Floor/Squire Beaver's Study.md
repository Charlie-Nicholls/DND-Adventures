###### Squire Beaver's Study

>	Squire Beaver's study is rather sparser than one might expect. There is an ornate desk with a few scattered papers and the standard array of stationary upon it. By it's side is a desk with a bulky telephone built into the wall, a few folders and an open telephone book. There are also a few books on shelves but the whole place seems gives the feel of a room there to give the impression of a man hard at work more than that of a room used to bustling activity.

You find a few scars hidden under his fur, most notably a large scar on the left side of his chest.
