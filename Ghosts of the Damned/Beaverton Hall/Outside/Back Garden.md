> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Easy (Dr Beaver's death)
>	Dr Beaver has been shot point blank in the head. He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small. There are deep footprints leading to the body. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden.

>	Dr Beaver has been shot point blank in the head but the angle is wrong for a suicide. He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small, seemingly the same style but belonging to his wife. There are deep footprints leading to the body. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired.

He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small, seemingly the same style but belonging to his wife. There are deep footprints leading to the body, they're too small for Dr Beaver and style of tread doesn't match his shoes. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden, you swear you recognise the handwriting. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired. The gun is in his right hand, but he was seen using his left. Out of the corner of your eye you more footprints on the other side of the garden.

>	Dr Beaver has been shot point blank in the head but the angle is wrong for a suicide. He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small, seemingly the same style but belonging to his wife. There are deep footprints leading to the body, they're too small for Dr Beaver and style of tread doesn't match his shoes. You have enough time to sketch their design before they're washed away. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden, you swear you recognise the handwriting. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired. The gun is in his right hand, but he was seen using his left despite being right handed. Out of the corner of your eye you more footprints on the other side of the garden, that mirror the ones here.
