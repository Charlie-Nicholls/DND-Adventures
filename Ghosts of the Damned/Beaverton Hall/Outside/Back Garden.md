> A wide expanse of field, flower and trees. The careful symmetry of the back garden has been somewhat broken by the new [[Séance Room]] but otherwise it's carefully maintained and a rather pleasant place for afternoon tea.

>> The fence spike the body landed on and the surrounding area has since been cleaned. But looking around the area you notice a large tree blocks the view of the adjacent [[Servants Quarters]] window to the one [[Irene Adams]] was seen falling from. The hedges would've also blocked the view of anything happening below shoulder level to the spectators on the other side. Where the main building meets the [[Séance Room]], there is a small [[Storage Area]] accessible behind some planks of wood that have been bent out of shape, the contents of which are hard to discern from where you are.

Looking around the area you notice a large tree blocks the view of the adjacent [[Servants Quarters]] window to the one [[Irene Adams]] was seen falling from. One of the larger branches of the tree has broken off recently. The hedges would've also blocked the view of anything happening below shoulder level to the spectators on the other side.

There may have been time to move something into or out of this area during the incident without anyone seeing, but they would've had to have been very quick to do so before [[Ruffles Hound]] emerged from the [[Séance Room]] and saw.

>> Dr Beaver has been shot point blank in the head. He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small. There are deep footprints leading to the body. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden.

>> Dr Beaver has been shot point blank in the head but the angle is wrong for a suicide. He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small, seemingly the same style but belonging to his wife. There are deep footprints leading to the body. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired.

He is wearing a dark black coat like the one he owns but it's a couple sizes too small, seemingly the same style but belonging to his wife. There are deep footprints leading to the body, they're too small for Dr Beaver and style of tread doesn't match his shoes. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden, you swear you recognise the handwriting. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired. The gun is in his right hand, but he was seen using his left. Out of the corner of your eye you more footprints on the other side of the garden.

There are deep footprints leading to the body, they're too small for Dr Beaver and style of tread doesn't match his shoes. You have enough time to sketch their design before they're washed away. In his pocket is a handwritten note asking to meet a few minutes before his death in the garden, you swear you recognise the handwriting. The gun in his hand matches the wound he received, but with no gunpowder traces, hasn't been fired. The gun is in his right hand, but he was seen using his left despite being right handed. Out of the corner of your eye you more footprints on the other side of the garden, that mirror the ones here.
