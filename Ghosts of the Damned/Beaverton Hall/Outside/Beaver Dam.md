- There are several gates that allow water through the damn to generate more or less power. These are controlled from the [[Power Control Room]].
- If a lever is flipped and remains flipped for one round, the corresponding gate will open/close at the same point in initiative next round. Usually the start of that creatures next turn.
- Any creature can use an action, prepared action, or bonus action to flip up to two levers. 
- Looking through the viewing port consumes your free object interaction, otherwise one lever can additionally be flipped as a free object interaction.
- Any creature in front of a gate when it opens must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be thrown over the edge.
- Any creature who moves through rushing water can either make a DC 12 Strength saving throw to move though it like difficult terrain, or else be thrown over the edge. Alternatively, they can consume their action to grip the railing and move through safely like it was difficult terrain, no save required.
- Any creature thrown over the edge can use a reaction to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to grasp the railing. A creature who does so is considered prone. Half their movement can be consumed to pull themselves back over the top if the gate is closed. If the gate is open this requires a DC 15 Atheletics check. A creature in this position who takes damage must make a Constitution saving throw of DC equal to half the damage taken or else fall.
- The damn is 100 ft. tall, any creature who falls off takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage.
