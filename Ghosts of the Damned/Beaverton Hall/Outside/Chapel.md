>	In the north east corner of the chapel, behind the pew, is a series of crates and blanket covered assortments of items. It seems rather haphazard and one box has fallen over and a bunch of old books spilled out.

**Anyone looking inside the tunnel will find the body of the real [[Mystic Myrtle]]**

> [!recite|nbrd no-i]- Easy (body)
>	There is wound in her chest, but a lack of blood around the wound. There is also some bruising around the arms and neck. You find a typewritten note on her which reads: "Will meet you at the station next Monday. Looking forward to finally getting to meet you!"

>	There is wound in her chest, but a lack of blood around the wound. There is also some bruising around the arms like she was restrained, and around the neck indicating strangulation. You find a typewritten note on her which reads: "Will meet you at the station next Monday. Looking forward to finally getting to meet you!" which is slightly damp in the corner where one might hold it despite how long it must've been here. The body shows signs of recent unnatural weight loss and dilated pupils.

>	There is wound in her chest, but a lack of blood around the wound and it is not what killed her. There is also some bruising around the arms like she was restrained, and around the neck indicating strangulation was the real cause of death. You find a typewritten note on her which reads: "Will meet you at the station next Monday. Looking forward to finally getting to meet you!" the corner is slightly damp where one might hold it, indicating it must've been found recently by someone else. It doesn't seem possible to know who sent it or to whom but it has recently been scrunched up in anger. The body shows signs of recent unnatural weight loss and dilated pupils.
