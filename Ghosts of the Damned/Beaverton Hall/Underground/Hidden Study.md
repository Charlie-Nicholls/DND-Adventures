>> Inside the desk draw you find a Victoria Cross medal, from what you know of him you'd think Squire Beaver would display this publicly so it's strange he kept it hidden. You find historical records of Squire Beaver's finances appearing to show he was in dire financial straits before the war, and very rich afterwards. The source of this increase in funds is unclear.

Unless maybe the work he got it for was secret? There are also records mentioning an injury he sustained in the line of duty that caused his retirement. You find historical records of Squire Beaver's finances appearing to show he was in dire financial straits before the war, and very rich afterwards. The source of the increase in funds is obscured, probably illicit.

Letters since `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Villain`'s death are addressed to her previous subordinates and get increasingly angry in tone, suggesting he viewed himself as her natural successor and wished to lead the organisation.

>> [!boxed|no-t]
>> This file tells the true story of `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].ChefRussian`'s trouble. The chef was previously a Russian smuggler who Squire Beaver worked with. They investigated a mole in their sect who was leaking their plans to the government. This mole was the Squire who was selling them through a third party. When the sect learned of a mole in their organization, Squire Beaver framed someone and then killed them before they could prove their innocence. He knew if `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].ChefRussian` could put it together given the chance, so he told the Kommidore `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].ChefRussian` was the leak and they tried to kill him, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].ChefRussian` was lead to believe by the Squire that the government though he killed the mole and were out for revenge. Squire Beaver's then used his British Government contacts to set `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].ChefRussian` up with a new life in England and a false identity under the name of "`= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Chef`".
