### 1 Suspicious Circumstances
#### 1.0 Opening
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	Inside an inconspicuous flat on Barker Street in the year 1924, sits an office in which the many adventures of Canis, a man widely regarded as the world's greatest detective, began, and were subsequently documented. Some would argue, of course, that he was simply the detective with the greatest publicist. Evidence of which can be seen in the many books lining the shelves here. All of which are in quite pristine condition, since those who own them, have no need to read them. On the table sits a typewriter, freshly stocked with paper and we watch as Featherwick Crowley walks across the room, sits down, and begins to type.

>	It has been the great honour of my life to document for the wider public, the cases to which Canis has turned his attention. From our first meeting in "The Mimicry Murders", through the infamous "Hound and the Badgervilles" and, of course his unrelenting investigation of criminal mastermind Harriet Adder, and the betrayal he ultimately faced. But no case has been as haunting and nothing has so tested my belief in the rational, as the events which occurred on the night of Squire Beaver's 50th birthday. It began in the summer just gone, in the way of many cases prior: with a knock at the door and a cry for help.

#### 1.1 The Death of Irene
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The story she told us began a few weeks earlier. Lady Beaver had recently had an extension built onto Beaverton Hall dedicated to her fascination in the occult and was throwing a small party to celebrate its opening. Most people had gone inside for lunch, but Catherine had stayed outside to talk her wife's cousin, who was visiting from America. Apparently she is quite famous there as some sort of performing psychic, going by the name 'Mystic Myrtle'.

### 2 Thunderbolt and Lightning

>	The night of Squire Beaver's birthday announced itself with much fanfare. Thunder echoed across the countryside in grim determination to set an appropriate backdrop. I've been to many such ominous parties now, and even in the height of summer this pathetic fallacy is alarmingly consistent. They all insist on being held in only the most remote of locations. Consider this advice to any high society readers, if you want to avoid being murdered at a party, don't hold it in a stormy moor.

### 3 Very Very Frightening
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	Chapter 3: Very Very Frighting
>	
>	It was towards the end of what was otherwise a very pleasant dinner that the spectre of Irene's death that had hung over our evening became realised all too literally. A sudden breeze swept through the room, extinguishing the flames of the candles on the dining table and seconds later the fire fizzled out leaving us in just the relatively dim light of the electric bulbs.
>^Chapter3

#### 3.1 Irene's Ghost
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The fire goes out and a gust of wind blows through the room leaving it in darkness. Perception to hear a scraping sound as glass is put into place. Suddenly, ⁠Irene Adams's ghostly image can be seen in the fireplace. Her voice echos through the room and you hear: "Squire Beaver, my death is on your hands, and I will see my revenge complete before the night is done". 
>^Chapter3-1

#### 3.2 Séance
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	Suddenly you hear a scream from Catherine and look over to see her pointing towards the windows on the left. A little distance away can be seen the semi-transparent form of Irene. She looks furious and points into the room and shouts, "I found what you did to her, stay away from my wife you monster."
>^Chapter3-2

#### 3.4 The Squire's Death
**Inside The Office**
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The lights begin to flicker, you hear a loud crash of thunder and the rush of water from the dam seems to intensify before the bulbs burst, plunging the room into darkness. You hear a distant laughter that for a moment you think you recognise. Then the Squire stands up and stumbles sideways. You hear a click and the sound of various objects clattering to the floor and the squire grunts. You see him open a draw and withdraw a knife which he then turns upon himself. His face is strained, eyes seeming to stare at something he can't see and the knife enters his chest. He struggles for a few seconds before collapsing in a heap before you, knife still clutched in his paws.
>^Chapter3-4

**Outside The Office (Perception Check)**

> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	The lights begin to flicker, you hear a loud crash of thunder and the rush of water from the dam seems to intensify. From inside the Squire's study a clattering sound can be heard and then a few seconds later a loud thump. Not long after the sounds die down and the lights return to normal.
