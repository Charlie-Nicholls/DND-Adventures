### Things to change for next time

- Scale of map, squares should be bigger, house takes too much movement to travel through in final fight currently
- Find a good reason why NPCs arent involved in final fight, particularly the colonel. maybe they're kept in the living room while FC is interviewed in the seance room with 1 or 2 witnesses (Dr herrring?)
- Work out exact distance between guest house and main house
- Rebalance number of safe spots on the dam, maybe remove them entirely, or have on at the far end
- probably make dam thinner too, only 5ft?
- Need to hide position of dam fighters to lever users until they look through the viewing port
- One extra officer probably, that way the plan can be one holding damn door, one at levers, one + ruffles with author
- Restat some of the characters, maybe come up with simplified character sheets with some of the superfluous abilities removed.
	- Canis very good at investigation + good at insight
	- Myrtle good at charisma + very good at insight
	- Featherwick very good at charisma + good at investigation
	- Winnie left out slightly, very good at strength/intimidation, maybe stat up his insight
