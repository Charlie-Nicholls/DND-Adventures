### Stage 1 - [[Irene Adams]]' Fake Death
**The Plan**
[[Irene Adams]] will fake her death by throwing the real `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Psychic`'s body out of the [[Servants Quarters]]' window before climbing out of another window down a tree which is obscuring this from view. [[Harriet Adder]]'s henchman [[Ruffles Hound]] will be positioned closest and will run over to “help”. Picking the body up and bringing it behind a bush, it is then hidden in the [[Storage Area]] and [[Irene Adams]] swaps in. `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Psychic` will be out on the lawn with [[Catherine Adams]] and `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Chef`. The only important thing here is when the ambulance arrives, [[Irene Adams]] needs to be either left alone or with [[Ruffles Hound]] so she can replace the original body for them to find.

**What you need to do**
***Low*** - Comfort [[Catherine Adams]] after [[Irene Adams]] dies and guide her away from the body.
***Low*** - Encourage `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Chef` to go help the ambulance crew. If [[Chef]] insists on staying with [[Irene Adams]] then the swap will be performed by contacts at the hospital.

### Stage 2 - [[Irene Adams]]' Ghost
**The Plan**
[[Irene Adams]]' ghost will appear in the fireplace during dinner. It threatens [[Squire Beaver]] then the curtains are opened, glass smashes and it disappears. 

**What you need to do**
***Low*** - Ideally [[Irene Adams]] will finish the full message and the chandelier will fall before anyone reaches the fireplace so it might be useful to encourage them to hear out the ghost.
***Medium*** - Open the curtain nearest the fireplace after [[Irene Adams]] says [[Squire Beaver]] will die. This causes the chandelier to fall and cover the broken glass. An NPC will do this if you do not, but it's better if `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Psychic` does it.

### Stage 3 - The Death of [[Squire Beaver]]
**The Plan**
When [[Squire Beaver]] goes to [[Squire Beaver's Study]] after dinner, you need to be in the [[Living Room]] near the [[Downstairs Bathroom]]. [[Irene Adams]] will go to the [[Power Control Room]] and start ramping up the power, this will make the lights flicker. On this signal you then withdraw into your shell, and sneak out and into the [[Downstairs Bathroom]] then down the secret passage. You kill [[Irene Adams]] and then overload the power to [[Squire Beaver's Study]], killing him, before sneaking back. The police are then called from the [[Guest House]], but the phoneline has been intercepted to go to your minions.

**What you need to do**
***High*** - Stand over by the sofas in the top left corner of the [[Living Room]]. When the lights flicker, act very scared and say you hide in your shell until some time has passed, likely till the body is found.
***High*** - If anyone tries to interact with you, say all they hear is whimpering coming from your shell and do not respond with dialogue as you are not there. A compact record player was placed the shell with recorded sounds of you whimpering, then the record is broken when you return.
***High*** - I will ask for Perception check rolls from everyone. You will roll with disadvantage from being in your shell. Tell me the result of both rolls. I will tell you what you hear along with everyone else but this is really a roll with advantage for how well you kill [[Irene Adams]] and modifies the difficulty to find related clues later.
***High*** - The police will be attempted to be called, but the phone in [[Squire Beaver's Study]] doesn't work. You may either ask me if you know of another phone, or I will have an NPC prompt you. This is an opportunity for you to leave, call your minions and move [[Irene Adams]]' body into her grave through a preprepared tunnel. If you leave alone, you will roll a Persuasion check when calling the police that modifies the difficulty to find related clues later. If do not manage to leave alone, still do the call, and you will have to find another time to separate and message me that you are hiding the body. 

### Stage 4 - The Death of [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]]
**The Plan**
After his father's death, [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] will begin to consider telling `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` everything about his involvement with [[Harriet Adder]]. I will be making rolls for this as time goes on, becoming more likely each time. You will have slipped [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] a note telling him to meet you outside at a later time. It is up to you to find an opportunity to get away from the group and meet [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]], if you do not then this murder will not happen or happen after he tells `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` his information.
You take the rifles from the [[Downstairs Hallway]] and his wife’s coat from the adjoining [[Cupboard Under Stairs]] and meet him outside far away from where people are, shooting him in time with a lightning strike to cover the sound. His body is then dragged behind the mirror in the [[Séance Room]], left with one of the rifles and you run round the other side. Dressed in the matching coat you pretend to shoot yourself, fall to the floor. [[Lady Beaver]] will be in the [[Séance Room]] and will see this in the mirror. She will run out the opposite side to you and sees the real body, you run off the right side, ditch the coat and gun in the [[Storage Area]] and come into the [[Séance Room]] to see this scene.

**What you need to do**
***Medium*** - Separate yourself from the group. The best time to do this is if they decide to visit the [[Guest House]] or its adjoining [[Chapel]] or [[Graveyard]] as they will be far away. Another good chance would be if they were underground one of the secret passages. Pick a justification for what you are doing in this time that keeps you away from the Players and NPCs too. Any simple Investigation check would suffice as I can message you the results as, even though you weren’t really doing the investigation, you could still know this information from being the murderer.
***Medium*** - When I say you hear the gunshot and screams from the [[Séance Room]], say you go there and you will likely be first to arrive.

### Stage 5 - The Finale
**The Plan**
There will be some police officers arriving and [[Ruffles Hound]] who are all secretly your minions. They will attempt to split the party, one officer taking you and `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` to the [[Guest House]] or the secret passage that leads there through the [[Downstairs Bathroom]]. The other minions will stay with all the other guests, bringing the other players into the [[Séance Room]], from which they can see `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective`’s death on the [[Beaver Dam]]. Once you reach the [[Guest House]] or if `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` resists, the officer will draw a gun and threaten him. You have two daggers stored inside your shell, and the officer will give you a gun once you have revealed yourself if there is a chance. Once you are revealed, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` is told that if he doesn't throw himself off the [[Beaver Dam]] at midnight, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned"]].Author` will be killed. If the group cannot be separated, then the officers will go with you all and improvise, attempt to split you or kidnap `= [[Ghosts of the Damned"]].Author`.

**What you need to do**
***Medium*** - Try to convince the others to follow the police instructions.
***High*** - Chose your moment to reveal yourself, make it as climactic as possible. Tell `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` that if he does not throw himself off the [[Beaver Dam]] by midnight, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned"]].Author` will be killed.
