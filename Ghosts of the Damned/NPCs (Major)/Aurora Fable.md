### Description
Weasel Brown is a career criminal, with ties to smuggling she has since put behind her after getting out of prison, but the heart of a con woman which she very much still indulges. Whilst in prison she was smuggled a knife by [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] and told to stab `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Villain` in return for which judges on her appeal would be bribed.
