### Description
Harriet is a master criminal and head of a massive network of smugglers and spies, weaving a web of political power and wealth through her skill in gathering secrets and blackmail. Some years ago, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` was closing in on her network, so she had her contacts perpetrate a crime against herself for him to investigate. During this time, she seduced him, and worked with him on several occasions, sometimes helping and sometimes leading him away from her network. Eventually, she was caught and imprisoned. 

[[Squire Beaver]] and his son, [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]], are both members of her network. [[Squire Beaver]] was a spy in Russia and sold both sides secrets to Harriet. [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] worked at the prison she was incarcerated in and was key in faking her death. He gave a knife to [[Aurora Fable|Weasel Brown]], with instructions to cause a scene and stab Harriet in the gut in return for blackmailing a judge to free her. Harriet had a stab proof vest and blood pack, and they used a trick medical table to fool `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` into thinking her dead.

[[Squire Beaver]] has become increasingly erratic and unreliable, and Harriet has a plan to eliminate some problematic individuals, while using them to get revenge on `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective`. When `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Psychic` arrived in the UK, she was accosted and stabbed by Harriet. A master of disguise and deception, she then took her place. On staying with the Beavers, she discovered [[Catherine Adams]] had been assaulted by [[Squire Beaver]], and recruited her wife [[Irene Adams]] into a plan for revenge against him. Though [[Irene Adams]] thinks the plan ends with [[Squire Beaver]]'s death, and believes Harriet to be `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Psychic`.

[[Irene Adams]] would fake her death, then appear to haunt [[Squire Beaver]] at dinner at his birthday. He would then be killed remotely by [[Irene Adams]] while locked in his office, in what could only be a suicide. Harriet then plans to kill [[Irene Adams]] and begin the second half of her plan, using a tunnel to replace [[Irene Adams]]’s body in her grave and tying up another loose end by killing [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] in another apparent possession suicide. Lastly, `= [[Ghosts of the Damned]].Detective` would be forced to throw himself off the [[Beaver Dam]] at midnight in front of the guests by threating the life of `= [[Ghosts of the Damned"]].Author`. Thus ending the life of the famous sceptic and detective with the cruel irony of a ghostly case he couldn’t solve.
