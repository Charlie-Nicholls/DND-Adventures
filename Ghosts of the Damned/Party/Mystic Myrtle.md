### Description
`=this.file.name` is an American psychic, who’s stage shows demonstrating her abilities as a medium have rocketed her to fame. She is also a charlatan, but would never explain how her tricks were done. Her cousin [[Catherine Adams]] and her family moved to England when she was a baby and they hadn’t met since. When `=this.file.name` was due for a UK tour, she contacted her cousin to see if they could meet up.
