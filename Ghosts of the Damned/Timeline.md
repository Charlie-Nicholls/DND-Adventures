#### 3.1 Irene's Ghost
#### 3.2 Séance
[[Lady Beaver]] calls [[Aurora Fable]], [[Mystic Myrtle]], [[Catherine Adams]], [[Squire Beaver]] and PCs who want to do a séance to attempt to contact [[Irene Adams]]. Doors to outside are locked, [[Lady Beaver]] has keys, should slow down players chasing [[Irene Adams]]. [[Mystic Myrtle]] is sat next to [[Catherine Adams]]. Starts with standard stuff but then [[Irene Adams]] appears outside. She seems slightly translucent due to partial lighting on the one-way mirror. She is heard to shout:
"I found what you did to her. Stay away from my wife you monster."

[[Irene Adams]] has discovered the body of [[Mystic Myrtle]] and worked out [[Harriet Adder]]. [[Harriet Adder]] is messaged on an insight check:
> [!recite|clean no-t]
>	"I found what you did to her" is directed at you, it seems she has found the body of the real Myrtle while hiding in the guest house and worked out you are an impostor. You think that she can be made to finish her part of the plan after which you can kill her anyway if you threaten Catherine. You can either mouth 'do your job or else' or hold a knife visibly above and behind Catherine such that only Irene can see if no-one turns around. The latter is more likely to work but is more risky, which do you choose?"
>^IntroText

If the knife is pulled Catherine Adams feels a cold shiver go down her spine. The lights are then turned on, making outside hard to see, mirror hides [[Irene Adams]] as she runs away.
