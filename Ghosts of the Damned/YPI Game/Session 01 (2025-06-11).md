###### Session 01
<span class="sub2">:FasCalendar: `=this.date`</span>
___

### Notes
- Ruffles told them he was hired to do the fences a month before the seance room, squire beaver did this, but harriet interfered to make the spikes less safe. None of the Beavers are clear who made this design choice.
- 17 Rolled for Killing Irene
- Start next session with the flashback to meeting dr beaver and seeing harriet's body
- Then have Hawking try the phone to call the police, Dr Beaver comment that it's been broken for weeks and they've had to use the one in the guest house and propose myrtle uses it as she's staying there and has the key, (if harriet doesn't jump in in to ask/suggest it)
- Have Hawkings suggest Winnie accompany Canis for his protection in case something or someone tries to hurt him
- Have Lady Beaver insist Mytle helps using her psychic powers, lean on the grief over her dead husband to force Canis to acquiesce 
- Every new scene roll to see if Dr Beaver will be willing to tell them Harriet is alive/will seek them out. Increasing in likelihood each time. Say on a 19/20 first time then 17-20 2nd time, 15-20 third time and so on.
- Read out room + character descriptions I missed on session 1
