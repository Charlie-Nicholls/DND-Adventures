### Plan
- [ ] If anyone meets [[Aurora Fable]] again, have them roll perception to see that she notably dry and did not go out in the rain to dr beaver's body despite being with lady beaver when he died. + fur dye if high
- [ ] Find some Adder poison that could've been used to cause harriet to be breathing extremely shallow
