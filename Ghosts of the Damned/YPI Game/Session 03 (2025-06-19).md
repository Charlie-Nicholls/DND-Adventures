### Plan
> [!recite|nbrd no-i] Formalities
> - [ ] Ask Conor to check if he halved damage from rage, restore half hp if so

- [ ] If anyone meets [[Aurora Fable]] again, have them roll perception to see that she notably dry and did not go out in the rain to dr beaver's body despite being with lady beaver when he died. + fur dye if high
- [ ] Mentioned door to the [[Servants Quarters]] was found locked from the inside, had to be broken
- [ ] Have Featherwick suggest to go over the full series of events. Try to get them to conclude Irene could not have died a few weeks prior + to check her grave

> Meanwhile, somewhere in a cold car on a lonely road during a thunderous night, sit a pig and a badger. They're dressed in police uniforms, badges crookedly affixed to the front and truncheon strapped to their waist. The badger turns to his left and asks "How much longer?". "About an hour and a half." responds the pig. The badger returns to his effort to try and catch up on the sleep he is missing, knowing in his heart it was futile - this is not a night for sleeping.

> [!boxed|no-t]
> I was investigating the damn with Ruffles. We had to head in through the guest house, past the adjoining [[Chapel]] and its associated [[Graveyard]], which he told me was where poor Irene was buried. The [[Beaver Dam|Dam]] itself seemed to be working just find, according to [[Ruffles Hound|Ruffles]]. its control room had a variety of readouts and controls I didn't understand, and though he qualified he wasn't an electrician, he said they seemed normal - though there had been a recent surge of power, particularly to a room marked 'SBS'. I myself had a quick investigation and found a lot of the wires and hydraulics lead to a small stairwell. But, before I could follow it, [[Ruffles Hound|Ruffles]] said he thought he heard a gunshot, but it was hard to tell over the thunder. We cautiously made our way outside to investigate. It was then that we heard what was definitely a gunshot and ran back to the house to find a few people standing around the body of [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]].
