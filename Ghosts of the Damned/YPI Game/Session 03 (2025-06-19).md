### Plan
- [ ] If anyone meets [[Aurora Fable]] again, have them roll perception to see that she notably dry and did not go out in the rain to dr beaver's body despite being with lady beaver when he died. + fur dye if high
- [ ] Find some Adder poison that could've been used to cause harriet to be breathing extremely shallow

> Mean while, I was investigating the damn with Ruffles. We had to head in through the guest house, past the adjoining [[Chapel]] and its associated [[Graveyard]], which he told me was where poor Irene was buried. The dam itself seemed to be working just find according to Ruffles. The dam's control room had a variety of readouts and controls I didn't understand, and though he qualified he wasn't an electrician he said they seemed normal - except that the fuse for the supply to [[Squire Beaver's Study]] had blown. I myself had a quick investigation and found in the corner there was a small stairwell, but before I could follow it we thought we heard what in our paranoia we thought might be a gunshot, but was obscured by thunder and froze, slowly making our way outside to investigate. It was then that we heard what was definitely a gunshot and ran back to the house to find a few people standing around the body of [[Dr Corbyn Beaver]] who told us you were upstairs.
