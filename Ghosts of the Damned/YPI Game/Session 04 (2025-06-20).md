- [ ] If they discover [[Ruffles Hound]] involvement and try to intimidate him, DC 14 he tells them about faking [[Irene Adams]]' death, DC 18 to also tell them about his business being a front, that he was hired to get plans for the house and to add the setup for the ghost trick in the fireplace, he also knows about the mirror in the [[SÃ©ance Room]]. DC 22 to also tell them about Featherwick being targeted.
- Leave at least one of the police or ruffles at the house, if a fight on the dam breaks out, they will go to the power control room and attempt to use the gate controls.
- The police/ruffles/adder will try to draw the fight out onto the damn, and lock or block the door behind them.
