### Ambush
- Find a cart overturned on the road with strixwolves (wolf with owlish features + wings, mother + 2 cubs) feeding on the bodies
- After a while or when they try to clear the path/go around it
	- DC 14 Instinct to see the ambush
	- Failure means I go first and gain 2 fear
- [[Ambush]]

### Finding the [[Hag of the Forest]]
> [!boxed|no-t]
> One tree, taller than the rest, bears a house that seems grown rather than made, like an overripe wooden fruit. It hangs from a braid of rope, as wide around as a giantâ€™s forearm, tied to a massive branch and counter-weighted by a cabin-sized bolder lying at the base of the tree. The stone is marked with a collection of symbols and the cabin windows flash with a soft, yellow-green light.

- Need to do something to grab the attention of the [[Hag of the Forest]], so she lowers her house
	- If they try to simply call from below, there is no response, but the light within still flickers.
	- If they try to cut the counterweight rope, it will immediately blast them backwards a few feet, dealing a point of Stress.
	- If they try to climb the tree, its an Agility Roll with a difficulty of 13. On a failure, a limb of the tree grabs them, gently sets them down on the forest floor, then resumes its original form
- She needs to be convinced to help
	- Dislikes the increase in logging, considers it unsustainable, it used to be that they would plant as many trees as they cut down.
		- Sees the druidic spirits frightening them off as a good thing
		- Would need some assurances they can help reduce logging (e.g. via Prince Kevin's connections, particularly if they can prove his brother's illegal massacre)
	- However also sees how the spirits existence is unbalancing the ecosystem of the forest and hurting the plants and animals.

### Ritual To Cleanse the Grove
- Short rest as the [[Hag of the Forest]] sets up the ritual
- Investigation of the Grove (overgrown battlefield feature) can reveal:
	- A symbol of Kevin's family
	- Evidence that identifies Kevin's brother's involvement directly
	- ?
- After which the spirits of the fallen druids appear an attack the party as the ritual nears completion
- Countdown (3x Number of players + 1)
	- Ticks down every enemy defeated by an amount equal to their battle point score
		- Bear = 4 points
		- Dire Wolf or Snake = 2 points
		- Giant Rat = 1 Point
	- Ticks up if the [[Hag of the Forest]] is attacked successfully (difficulty 13)
- If the players are taking a lot of damage, attack the [[Hag of the Forest]] more and don't summon reinforcements.
- If it is too easy, summon more creatures.
