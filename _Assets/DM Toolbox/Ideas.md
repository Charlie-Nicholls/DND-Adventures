### Modron Taskmaster
Set something in the Acheron, the lawful neutral plane. Have tasks that need to be completed but they have to follow specific rules (like some sort of dungeon designed to stop people just stealing things by having rules you have to agree to to enter). Rules in the plane become physical laws. So you may not touch the 'x' means it becomes physically impossible to touch 'x', but they can come up with workarounds that technically follow the rules.
